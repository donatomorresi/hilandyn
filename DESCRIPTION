Description: Implementation of the High-dimensional detection of Landscape Dynamics (HILANDYN) algorithm for mapping forest disturbance dynamics through the segmentation of high-dimensional Landsat time series. 
    High-dimensional Landsat time series include information from the spatial and spectral dimensions and are analysed using the High-dimensional Trend Segmentation (HiTS) procedure proposed by Maeng (2019).
    The HiTS procedure aims to detect changepoints in a piecewise linear signal where their number and location are unknown. Changes can occur in the intercept, slope or both of linear trends.
