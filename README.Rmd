## About

`hilandyn` provides an implementation of the High-dimensional detection of Landscape Dynamics algorithm (Morresi et al. 2024) for mapping forest disturbance dynamics through the segmentation of high-dimensional Landsat time series into linear trends.

High-dimensional Landsat time series include information from the spatial and spectral dimensions and are analysed using the High-dimensional Trend Segmentation (HiTS) procedure proposed by Maeng (2019). The HiTS procedure aims to detect changepoints in a piecewise linear signal where their number and location are unknown. Changes can occur in the intercept, slope or both of linear trends.

`hilandyn` uses the `terra` package for raster and vector data management and the `future` package for parallel computation.


## Installation

You can install the development version of hilandyn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donatomorresi/hilandyn")
```
