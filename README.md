`hilandyn` is an *R* package that provides an implementation of the
High-dimensional detection of Landscape Dynamics algorithm (Morresi *et
al.* 2024) for mapping forest disturbance dynamics by segmenting
high-dimensional Landsat time series into linear trends.

High-dimensional Landsat time series include information from the
spatial and spectral dimensions and are analysed using a modified
version of the High-dimensional Trend Segmentation (HiTS) procedure
proposed by Maeng (2019). The HiTS procedure aims to detect changepoints
in a piecewise linear signal where their number and location are
unknown. Changes can occur in the intercept, slope or both of linear
trends.

`hilandyn` uses the `terra` package for raster and vector data
management and the `future` package for parallel computation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hilandyn from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donatomorresi/hilandyn")
```
